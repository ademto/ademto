# 👋 Hi, I'm Emmanuel Adetoro

🔐 **Cybersecurity Professional | Full-Stack Developer | Cloud Security Enthusiast**

I make computers do things you *can’t possibly imagine*. From identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers could exploit them, to building secure, scalable web platforms — I bridge the gap between development and defense.

My GitHub is a hub for cybersecurity tools, full-stack projects, and cloud security labs, all created to support ethical hacking, digital defense, and real-world learning.
