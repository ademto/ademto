# 👋 Hey, I'm Emmanuel Adetoro

I make computers do things you *can't possibly imagine*. From identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before attackers could exploit them, to building secure, scalable web platforms — I bridge the gap between development and defense.

> “I code for impact, I secure for defense, and I build for the Kingdom.”
